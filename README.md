## **Module 1: Introduction to Ethical Hacking**

### **Core Concepts**

#### **What is Hacking?**
- The act of gaining unauthorized access to systems or networks by exploiting vulnerabilities.
- The goal can be ethical (security improvement) or malicious (theft, damage).

#### **What is Ethical Hacking?**
- The **authorized** practice of employing hacking skills to test an organization's defenses.
- The goal is to identify and report vulnerabilities so they can be fixed.
- Also known as **Penetration Testing** or **Security Auditing**.

#### **Types of Hackers: The "Hats"**
- **White Hat:** The ethical hacker. Works with permission to improve security.
- **Black Hat:** The malicious hacker. Breaks in for personal or financial gain.
- **Grey Hat:** Operates without explicit permission but without pure malicious intent (e.g., hacking to expose a flaw publicly).

### **The Legal & Ethical Framework**
This was the most critical part of the lesson. Ethical hacking is defined by its boundaries:
1.  **Authorization is Mandatory:** Must have a signed contract/agreement before any testing begins.
2.  **Respect the Scope:** Testing must not go beyond the agreed-upon limits (e.g., no Denial-of-Service attacks unless specified).
3.  **Confidentiality:** All findings and accessed data must remain confidential, often under an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).

### **Methodologies & Frameworks**
Briefly introduced to industry standards that guide professional testing:
- **OWASP:** Provides testing guides for Web, Mobile, and IoT applications.
- **NIST SP 800-115:** A technical guide for information security testing.
- **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):** A comprehensive standard defining 7 phases of a penetration test.
