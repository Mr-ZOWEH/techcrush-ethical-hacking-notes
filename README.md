## **Module 1: Introduction to Ethical Hacking**

### **Core Concepts**

#### **What is Hacking?**
- The act of gaining unauthorized access to systems or networks by exploiting vulnerabilities.
- The goal can be ethical (security improvement) or malicious (theft, damage).

#### **What is Ethical Hacking?**
- The **authorized** practice of employing hacking skills to test an organization's defenses.
- The goal is to identify and report vulnerabilities so they can be fixed.
- Also known as **Penetration Testing** or **Security Auditing**.

#### **Types of Hackers: The "Hats"**
- **White Hat:** The ethical hacker. Works with permission to improve security.
- **Black Hat:** The malicious hacker. Breaks in for personal or financial gain.
- **Grey Hat:** Operates without explicit permission but without pure malicious intent (e.g., hacking to expose a flaw publicly).

### **The Legal & Ethical Framework**
This was the most critical part of the lesson. Ethical hacking is defined by its boundaries:
1.  **Authorization is Mandatory:** Must have a signed contract/agreement before any testing begins.
2.  **Respect the Scope:** Testing must not go beyond the agreed-upon limits (e.g., no Denial-of-Service attacks unless specified).
3.  **Confidentiality:** All findings and accessed data must remain confidential, often under an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).

### **Methodologies & Frameworks**
Briefly introduced to industry standards that guide professional testing:
- **OWASP:** Provides testing guides for Web, Mobile, and IoT applications.
- **NIST SP 800-115:** A technical guide for information security testing.
- **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):** A comprehensive standard defining 7 phases of a penetration test.

🧠 Day 2 — Information Security Fundamentals (CIA Triad, Controls, Risk & Compliance)

Date: 2025-10-21
Bootcamp: TechCrush Ethical Hacking Bootcamp (#techcrushHQ)
Facilitator: Caleb Ndubuisi

🗒️ Summary

Today’s class laid the groundwork for every ethical hacker and blue-team defender.
We explored the CIA Triad, Information Assurance, the three layers of security controls, the risk formula, and the laws & compliance frameworks that govern modern cybersecurity.

It was a reminder that hacking responsibly isn’t just about tools — it’s about protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability with ethics and structure.

🔍 What I Learned

🧩 1. The CIA Triad

Confidentiality – prevent unauthorized access (encryption, passwords).

Integrity – keep data accurate & untampered (hashing, version control).

Availability – ensure authorized users can access resources when needed (redundancy, backups).


🛡️ 2. Information Assurance (IA)

Ensures authenticity, reliability, and trust throughout data’s life cycle.

Achieved through administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.


⚙️ 3. Security Controls Categories

Type	Focus	Example

Administrative	Policies, training, HR processes	Security policies, awareness sessions
Technical	Hardware/software mechanisms	Firewalls, MFA, IDS, encryption
Physical	Tangible barriers	CCTV, locks, biometric access


Each works together to form a layered defense (Defense-in-Depth).

📊 4. Risk Assessment

Formula:

RISK = THREAT * VULNERABILITY * IMPACT

A Risk Matrix compares likelihood vs consequence, helping prioritize what to fix first.

📚 5. Security Laws & Standards

GDPR (EU) – global privacy benchmark

NDPA (Nigeria) – 2023 data protection law

HIPAA (US) – healthcare information security

SOX (US) – financial record integrity

PCI DSS – payment card data protection

ISO/IEC 27001/27701 – global ISMS standards


🤝 6. Ethical & Compliance Principles

Lawful data handling & informed consent

Transparency and accountability

Minimal data collection & responsible storage
